;	jQuery Library
;	--------------
EO_JQ_LIB_STATE_DESC="<b>Auto Load:</b> The jQuery library will be loaded only when needed by the Joomla framework. In this case the plugin checks if it exists in the 'head' section in ram, before the 'head' is even constructed. This will work for Joomla 3 core and can cover Joomla 3 extensions that use the Joomla framework functionality. Extensions that load jQuery in a different way will not be detected. Also active plugins that are forgotten and load the jQuery library and are set below 'eorisis jQuery' in the Plugin Manager may also not be detected.<br><br><b>Always Load:</b> The jQuery library will be loaded in all cases.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If you run Joomla 2.5, the 'Auto Load' option will result in not loading the library, once in Joomla 2.5, jQuery does not exist in the Joomla framework."
EO_JQ_LIB_VERSION_CHOICE_DESC="<b>Default:</b> Auto<br><b>Recommended:</b> Specific<br><br><b>Auto:</b> It will automatically use the jQuery library version that your Joomla version requires (Joomla 3). If you are not running Joomla 3 it will automatically use the latest available and recommended version. The plugin must be up-to-date.<br><br><b>Specific:</b> You can choose from the list of jQuery library versions available. Should be checked every time you update the plugin and Joomla. Always check your website when upgrading to a new version of the jQuery library. Old jQuery scripts may be incompatible with an up-to-date jQuery library.<br><br><b>Custom:</b> You can type in the Custom Version field, the version of the jQuery library you want to use, set the type (Minified/Uncompressed) and set a Local Path."
EO_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_DESC="Choose 'CDN' for a list of CDN sources or 'Local / Custom CDN' to load the file(s) from the local path (or your own CDN). A copy of every 'Specific' version of the jQuery library exists in the /media/ directory of your website. To configure a Custom CDN, check the Advanced tab.<br><br>CDN (Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network) is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet. Using CDN as a Source you increase website performance dramatically."
EO_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_CDN_DESC="Choose the CDN you think is best for you. All CDN Sources listed do have SSL available. The plugin uses Scheme Relative (protocol-less or protocol-relative) URLs for all CDN sources (no http/https conflicts).<br><br><b>Note:</b> Google's domain is banned in some countries."
EO_VERSION_SPECIFIC_DESC="<b>Current Default Version:</b> 1.11.3<br><br>jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8.<br><br>To troubleshoot cases where old scripts are used on your website and you see unexpected results, lowering the jQuery version is a good practice although it is recommended to update your scripts and use an up-to-date jQuery version. If you use a CDN Source, always make sure that the Source does have the version you chose to use (especially if the version you chose is too new or too old)."
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_LBL="Custom Version:"
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_DESC="It will only be used if the 'Version to use' is set to 'Custom'.<br>Only version characters accepted.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> 1.8.2<br><b>Example 2:</b> 1.4.4rc2<br><br>If the version for the jQuery library you want to use does not exist in the 'Specific' version list, you may set it here. If you use CDN as source, make sure the version you set here exists on the CDN you chose to use."
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_TYPE_LBL="Custom Version Type:"
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_TYPE_DESC="It will only be used if the 'Version to use' is set to 'Custom'.<br><b>Default:</b> Minified<br><b>Recommended:</b> Minified<br><br><b>Minified Filename Example:</b> jquery-1.8.2.min.js<br><b>Uncompressed Filename Example:</b> jquery-1.8.2.js"
EO_MINIFIED="Minified"
EO_UNCOMPRESSED="Uncompressed"
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_LOCAL_PATH_LBL="Custom Version Local Path:"
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_LOCAL_PATH_DESC="It can only be used if the 'Version to use' is set to Custom. It is the path to the directory/folder on your server, that contains the local file to be used in case you have selected 'Local / Custom CDN' as Source, or you have CDN Fallback enabled. The path can only be local/internal and is relative to your Joomla web root. No special characters or spaces are allowed. It is recommended to place your custom folder/directory inside the /media/ directory.<br><br><b>Example Local Path:</b> media/my-custom-folder/libs/<br><br><b>Important:</b> Do not include the rest of the server system path in the front, nor the filename (of the JS file) in the end of the path in this field. The filename in the result URL will be automatically constructed using your 'Custom Version' and 'Custom Verstion Type' settings. The filenames inside your custom folder on your server must include the version, the type and must have 'js' extension as shown in the following examples:<br><br><b>Example Filename 1:</b> jquery-1.8.2.min.js<br><b>Example Filename 2:</b> jquery-1.8.2.js<br><br><b>Note:</b> Do not use your domain in the path or start with http/https, as those are controlled in the Advanced tab. You can omit the beginning and trailing forward slashes of the path (/..../). For Windows server users, although this is a path that exists on the file system of your server, it will be used as part of the URL that will point to the file, so do not use backslashes (\).<br><br><b>Warning:</b> Do not upload files or create any custom folder inside the /media/eorisis-jquery/ directory, as they will be wiped out after an update of the plugin."

;	Migrate
;	-------
EO_MIGRATE_DESC="Migrate can be included with versions of jQuery as old as 1.6.4 to identify potential upgrade issues via its JQMIGRATE console warnings. However, it is only required for jQuery 1.9.0 or higher to restore deprecated and removed functionality. If you choose 'Auto Load' Migrate will load when using jQuery library 1.9.0 or higher."

;	---------
;	jQuery UI
;	---------

EO_UI_THEME_DESC="'Base' theme is used in UI 1.10.0 or lower versions, was brought back in version 1.11.3 and it was removed again in version 1.11.4. If 'Base' theme is selected and the UI version selected is not within those version ranges, then 'UI Lightness' will be used.<br><br>Theme Images will be loaded only when using CDN as source or when using 'Use Custom UI Files'."
EO_UI_VERSION_DESC="<b>Current Default Version:</b> 1.9.2<br><br>jQuery UI 1.11.x and 1.10.x series need jQuery library 1.6+<br>jQuery UI 1.11.x series is Stable, while versions 1.10.4 or older are Legacy.<br>Versions below 1.10.1 have a 'Base' theme.<br>Versions below 1.10.0 have no minified CSS theme files except the 'Base' theme.<br>Version 1.11.3 brought back the 'base' theme.<br>Version 1.11.4 removed the 'base' theme again."

Take the time to check your HTML Source Code on your web browser well.<br><br><b>Custom jQuery UI Builder:</b> jqueryui.com/download<br><b>More Info:</b> eorisis.com/jquery/doc"

;	-----------------
;	Twitter Bootstrap
;	-----------------
EO_BOOTSTRAP_DESC="Warning: In Joomla 3, it is fine to use any of the official Twitter Bootstrap 2.x series versions in the 'Site' (Front End) area. But using any official version in the 'Administrator' area when the default template is used, will break JavaScript functionality on some elements. Twitter Bootstrap 3.x series is currently not compatible with Joomla 3, but advanced users can use Custom Media and Remove Media fields. More info: eorisis.com/jquery/doc"
EO_BOOTSTRAP_THEME_DESC="Available in Twitter Bootstrap 3.x series only.<br>When enabled the file bootstrap-theme.min.css will be loaded as well, if the 'Elements' setting includes CSS."

EO_REMOVE_CSS_LBL="Remove CSS:"
EO_REMOVE_CSS_URLS_LBL="Remove CSS URLs:"
EO_REMOVE_URLS_DESC="There may be cases where scripts or StyleSheets loaded on a website from other extensions may cause trouble so that a webmaster may not be able to find a way to disable/remove them if no options are given. A temporary solution is to use these fields and add those URLs that need to be removed from the 'head' section (one per line).<br><br><b>Note:</b> This is a highly discouraged method or way of keeping your website online. Use this as a temporary solution only. Request from your developers to give you options. If the Scripts or StyleSheets do not get removed, it means that they get loaded without using the Joomla framework functions. URLs outside the 'head' section of the page will not be detected. The fields are Case-Sensitive. You can add either full, or part of the URLs to be removed (full is recommended)."

In reality browsers seem to apply 'all' if the attribute is omitted."
EO_CUSTOM_CDN_LBL="Custom CDN:"
EO_CUSTOM_CDN_DESC="If you use a CDN (i.e., MaxCDN) and you want to use it as a source (prefix all your local URLs with your CDN URL), then enable this option. This will have the effect of changing all URLs to start with your CDN URL and deliver all local content from it.

This means that in the case you are able to access i.e., example.com from www.example.com (or any other subdomain), then the current Domain (FQDN) will be the one you access it from. For users that prefer Scheme Relative or Absolute Local URLs and need to force the plugin to use a specific Domain (FQDN) that will not change, then the 'Custom' option should be used.<br><br>If you have set the $live_site variable in your configuration.php file, then you should not worry and choose Auto here, although on websites that use both http and https on different pages the $live_site causes trouble and is not recommended."
EO_FQDN_CUSTOM_LBL="Custom Domain (FQDN):"
EO_FQDN_CUSTOM_DESC="Accepted format should be without scheme (http or https), without :// and without the relative path.<br><br><b>Correct Entry Examples:</b><br>example.com<br>www.example.com<br>other.subdomain.example.com<br><br><b>Wrong Entry Examples:</b><br>http://example.com<br>http://www.example.com/joomla/<br>http://example.com/index.php<br>www.example.com/joomla"

For example, if you set jQuery UI on Site And Administrator (All) then set the jQuery library on Site And Administrator (All) as well.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Joomla 3 loads the jQuery library in both Site and Administrator by default.

You need cURL enabled on your server for this feature to work. Also, if you have enabled the 'System - Cache' plugin in Joomla, then this feature cannot work properly.
